ferguson*500327106824245249*@AngryBlackLady It smells don't it. This is the plan to get Darren Wilson off. Period.
ferguson*500327106824245249*@AngryBlackLady @Only4RM They're trying to skirt the situation &amp; take focus off of Darren Wilson.  Who's left over to blame ?  Dead victim.
ferguson*500327106824245249*@AngryBlackLady Hopefully not - I'm seeing a lot of people who recognize that his involvement in the robbery is irrelevant to his execution
ferguson*500327106824245249*@AngryBlackLady that was their intent all along. Brown will be painted a "thug" and "deserves" what he got.

charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@Chusid2015 @DaliaChai @cnnbrk look you fool we are talking revenge. If u abuse any religion . Revenge will be taken that simple
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer yeah ? I'd like to see you respond this way to anti-Semitic children's programs on Gaza tv @DaliaChai @cnnbrk
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@Chusid2015 @DaliaChai @cnnbrk you fool . We r not talking of Gaza. Anti semitsm and no laws anti protection of islam
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @DaliaChai @cnnbrk why are we not talking of Gaza, ya sidi ?
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk freedom of speech protects everyone. Islam just doesn't believe in freedom or democracy. Just death
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@DaliaChai @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk where is Islam protected under freedom of speech.  Show me any law. No law. So these guys right to kill
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk civilized countries have civilized laws that protect everyone. Islamics don't get 2 murder &amp; say defense
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@DaliaChai @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk what civilization.  If you can abuse a religion and no law to protect any religion. So Muslims are guardians
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@Chusid2015 @hassanbasmer @cnnbrk no it's ok to offend everyone else. Precious pedophile needs to be protected
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@DaliaChai @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk pedophiles is accepted in Judaism.  Read torah.  Who gave these fools right to make fun of Islam
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @DaliaChai lol moron I'm a rabbinical student. Don't tell me to find non existent things in the Torah
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk it is a disgrace in Judaism. And christianity. It's applauded in Islam. Child rape pretending 2 b marriage
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@DaliaChai @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk come on Rabbis have wives as young as six. Hehehe. What is that not rape and pedophiles
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @DaliaChai I have a lamp that I will sell you. If you rub it long enough a genie will emerge and grant you three wishes
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @DaliaChai but it seems clear that you agree that the legitimate #Islamic response to the #CharlieHebdo satire was murder. 😶
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@DaliaChai @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk yes because islam is true religion. They don't take Bullshit from fools like Charlie Have died.
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @DaliaChai lol the true all-embracing, multicultural attitude of "moderate" Islam comes out
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk well if murder, pedophilia &amp; hate is ur true religion, then u deserve the hatred &amp; offense u get! Done w/u
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@DaliaChai @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk hatred pedophile and disgrace in Judaism . We as Muslims don't accept . What freedom if abuse Islam. Death
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @DaliaChai do you live in an actual tent ? And is your name Saladin or something
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 11million arabs/Muslims killed by arab/Muslims since 1948. U r offended by eachother

charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @DaliaChai I feel that the intellectual level of this discourse has kinda gone to hell
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@Chusid2015 @DaliaChai easy just accept the truth and accept. You see abuse people not religion any where in the world. All religions
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk go away. Sorry excuse for human
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk thanks tho for being honest about the Islamic excuses for murder
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk anti semitism results in ppl killing Jews. But Jews don't slaughter anyone for offensive cartoons
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@DaliaChai @hassanbasmer don't think any1 is having trouble understanding what this is about. Kind if silly to compare this to anti-Semitism
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @cnnbrk free speech. They made fun of everyone! Only islamics kill ppl for a joke. A cartoon. A little offense. No excuse
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@DaliaChai @cnnbrk that's the problem. Muslims are serious in their only and one true religion. They won't abuse of jesus moses or mohammed
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @cnnbrk pathetic waste of air. Thanks for showing the excuse for Islamic butchery
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@DaliaChai @hassanbasmer @cnnbrk also in the creation of the zionist state it was a norm for jews to dress up as muslims and bomb people
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@mohamudaish @hassanbasmer @cnnbrk go away. It's what arabs do
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@DaliaChai @hassanbasmer @cnnbrk u heard it from me no muslim unless brainwashed will kill innocent people even if u abuse prophet
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@mohamudaish @hassanbasmer @cnnbrk lots &amp; lots brainwashed then. Seeing ur comments shows how widespread
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@DaliaChai @hassanbasmer @cnnbrk they are discusting animals
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@Mariodinava @DaliaChai @cnnbrk Muslims feel they r being attacked everywhere not even their religion. These tend to happen. No protection
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @Mariodinava @cnnbrk Bcoz they r killing people! Slaughtering. 'In the name of their prophet' no one else is doing that.
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@DaliaChai @Mariodinava @cnnbrk sorry not in name of Prophet.  In the name of God. Ezra to Jews is son of God. Just u guys r idol worship
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @Mariodinava @cnnbrk its not islamaphobia to call an Islamic terrorist what he is. Muslims r silent &amp; won't stand up
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @cnnbrk dif between satire &amp; hatred. No Islamic sense of humor. Jihadists don't know what free speech means
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@DaliaChai @cnnbrk what freedom when you abuse a religion. These guys are freedom fighters for protecting Islam.  Why no law protect religio
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @cnnbrk freedom fighters ? ? Fighting AGAINST everyone else's freedom. Go away
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @cnnbrk islam is not a religion its a brainwashed cult.
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@signlab9 @cnnbrk hehehe yah like Judaism Christianity and worst hinduism. This is what fools in churches call it. Because they are afraid
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@hassanbasmer @cnnbrk but the priests,rabbis&amp; ministers don't preach(kill all non moooslims)  not yet  but lets hope we get it on.easy prey.
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@signlab9 @hassanbasmer @cnnbrk so is free speach
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@mohamudaish @hassanbasmer @cnnbrk settle down just came back from emirates,arabs r just fine its these brainwashed moooslims that r cause
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@zhuravkov67 @cnnbrk satire. Get it ? Insults r free speech. Cowardice &amp; murder r not. Islamic terror is celebrated by its followers
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@zhuravkov67 @cnnbrk infidels that r breathing offends these monsters. Freedom offends them.
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@DaliaChai @cnnbrk reason forthis massacre is a concrete action of paper.not general principles of freedom.
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@zhuravkov67 @cnnbrk no it was Islamic teaching that freedom of speech is offensive to Islam, but killing is just dandy
charliehebdo*552805488631758849*@DaliaChai @cnnbrk u r better expert.  I doubt but I am not expert.If so than my question why western govts tolerate all those Muslim groups

charliehebdo*552806309540528128*@Colvinius @MartinRJay  What I mean is that they know Muslims take no jokes when it's related to their religion, book or prophet. Why do it ?
charliehebdo*552806309540528128*@Red4Mira @MartinRJay Because not to do it for any religion creates a class of people who can't be criticised.
charliehebdo*552806309540528128*@Colvinius @Red4Mira true but there's a huge difference between being criticized and satirized, no ?
charliehebdo*552806309540528128*@MartinRJay @Red4Mira So Jon Stewart, John Oliver, Colbert, Private Eye all fair game ? Freedom of speech includes ridicule.
charliehebdo*552806309540528128*@Colvinius @MartinRJay  Freedom of speech shud never mean to give the press the right to trash others or ruin others image just bec they CAN
charliehebdo*552806309540528128*@Red4Mira @MartinRJay So your answer to my question is yes. Enough said. Bye.
charliehebdo*552806309540528128*@Colvinius @Red4Mira yes freedom of speech is v broad but some cultures r behind the anglo saxons on self criticism, that's all.

charliehebdo*552806309540528128*@Red4Mira @MartinRJay In other words, satire isn't satire and free speech isn't free speech if some people are 'beyond ridicule'.
charliehebdo*552806309540528128*@Red4Mira @Colvinius @MartinRJay why do it ? Hmm, because that's how societies evolve, by breaking down taboos, accepting ridicule

ottawashooting*524924619812511746*@ashleyjmorton @CBCAlerts Give it one hour and my points will be confirmed.
ottawashooting*524922729485848576*@nomedeplume84 I would like to be paid for it, on account of being a journalist.
ottawashooting*524922729485848576*@Henderburn @nomedeplume84 ...seriously ?! You're trying to profit from this ? Think about it...
ottawashooting*524922729485848576*@cholmes96 I was there before the police were
ottawashooting*524922729485848576*@tdgecas yeah posting information about an evolving shooter situation is less worthwhile than an untrained journalist performing CPR
ottawashooting*524922729485848576*@Henderburn don't have to give cpr. Other ways to help. But yeah keep looking for profit. Great professionalism.
ottawashooting*524922729485848576*@tdgecas @Henderburn "professional, adjective: engaged in a specified activity as one's main paid occupation rather than as a pastime"
ottawashooting*524922729485848576*@tdgecas @Henderburn so yeah, expecting to get paid for doing his job seems pretty professional to me
ottawashooting*524922729485848576*@tdgecas @henderburn I didn't realize you were on the scene and could verify that he could have saved the life of the guy shot four times.
ottawashooting*524922729485848576*@BigDilbertFan Call 911 ? Signal for help ? Keep an eye out for the rescuers ? Simply ask the people if there's anything he can do ?
ottawashooting*524922729485848576*@tdgecas You don't have any evidence that he didn't do any of these things in addition to taking a picture, but you accuse away.
ottawashooting*524922729485848576*@tdgecas Way to care for people.
ottawashooting*524922729485848576*@Henderburn stay safe. Hope you're never in the same situation.
ottawashooting*524922729485848576*@tdgecas @Henderburn I agree Tyler, have some respect.That man shot is servicing your country and all you want to do is snap a pic.Pity you!
ottawashooting*524922729485848576*@DriesBrent do you think I shouldn't have used social media to warn people ? What should I have done ?
ottawashooting*524922729485848576*@Henderburn my main issue was the picture. Heard your reporting on cnn thought you did a good job. Continue to be safe.
ottawashooting*524922729485848576*@DriesBrent @tdgecas @Henderburn You have a phone! Did you call for help ? Nope. I took pics to sell and tweeted that I'm on CNN and ABC.

ottawashooting*524964948683005952*@Cdn_Bowhunter @CBCAlerts @CBCNews @JustinTrudeau #Afghanistan is the only country needed help
ottawashooting*524964948683005952*@DaryusAzad yes, but the liberals put us into direct combat by sending is to Kandahar. So why blame the CPC for this attack.
ottawashooting*524964948683005952*@Cdn_Bowhunter Kanadar needs Canadian help, afghans welcome foreign help. Today Afghanistan is much better place thanks to Canada
ottawashooting*524964948683005952*@DaryusAzad Yes it is, my point is though the liberals started us into this chain of events within foreign policy, CPC just continued it.
ottawashooting*524964948683005952*@Cdn_Bowhunter I believe #cpc pushed it too far
ottawashooting*524964948683005952*@DaryusAzad @CBCAlerts @CBCNews @JustinTrudeau No ones even confirmed this was an Islamic attack yet.
ottawashooting*524964948683005952*@DaryusAzad @CBCAlerts @CBCNews @JustinTrudeau you did, you blamed our foreign policy to start with...

ottawashooting*524964948683005952*@DaryusAzad perhaps, Trudeau is not that change. He's out of touch with most Canadians, he's not ready to run this country.

ferguson*500279160795721728*@Alasscan_ @DanteB4u It's a LIE. Police originally said confrontation started b/c cop told Michael to get out of street &amp; walk on sidewalk.
ferguson*500279160795721728*@DanteB4u IMO no shot should've happened. Call was unarmed suspect, cop had full description, easy to find where he lived @orangeseahorse
ferguson*500279160795721728*@DanteB4u Besides a person who committed a robbery wouldn't call attention to himself by walking in the middle of the street. It's a lie.

germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@Minus777 @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe yes but every second not spent trying to save everyone.....
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe It turns out there was no distress call made. I'm almost certain this was a hi-jacking now.
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe Unless they became rapidly unconcious
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe It looks like someone was flying it manually, all the way into the ground.
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@Minus777 @marcepa49 @isobelroe For sure not, it was following exactly the same flight path as day before https://t.co/JoVKD5OHC0
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@flightradar24 @Minus777 @marcepa49 @isobelroe Yep, it's follow exactly the route going down, that seems to suggest unconscious pilots.
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@flightradar24 @marcepa49 @isobelroe What I'm saying is, I believe it was deliberately crashed. Being controlled all the way into the ground
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe which seems to be the case.Constant descent, wind variations set aside..
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe They're saying what I said, the crash was a deliberate act. Controlled flight all the way down.
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe Or autopilot. But sure deliberately set.
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe I don't think the autopilot was engaged.
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe They're now saying the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane.
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe That's what they say.
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe The data from the transponder made it obvious.
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe It was obvious it was being manually controlled by the changes in descent rate. Also no
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe distress call. I thought it was hi-jacked and being flown by then. If it's true that the co-pilot did
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe crash it deliberately, the whole industry needs a shake-up.
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@marcepa49 Have you operated a flight mqnagement computer before ? I used to test them. What FlightRadar24 is ahowing is changes made
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@marcepa49 the flight profile. That doesn't indicate that the autopilot was set to 100 feet. I've worked on these systems, tested them
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe and have operated them in sumulators. Also on actual flights when I've been in the flight deck.
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe Look at the time on each line. The altitudes are requested not achieved.
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@marcepa49 But that's the FMC, doesn't mean autopilot was engaged.
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@Minus777 what's the use of changing FMC if autopilot not engaged ?
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@marcepa49 It changes the flight profile and cuts out the warnings and some of the protection.
germanwings-crash*580325090367315968*@marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe Would be good to get the data from the Flight Data Recorder though.

ferguson*500307001629745152*@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 For you to declare he was executed without any facts is also as absurd.

ferguson*500307001629745152*@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 If he was shot in the chest or back is the biggest factor in who is right.
ferguson*500307001629745152*@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 If he was shot in the back he was running away but shot in the chest he could have been charging.

ferguson*500307001629745152*@jlpauk why would the ferguson PD and STLCO PD release the information they've released and fail to mention that ?

ferguson*500307001629745152*@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 I'm relying on details agreed upon by the police and the witnesses.

ferguson*500307001629745152*@jlpauk there's a difference between an open mind and an empty one
ferguson*500307001629745152*@Tom_sveb An open mind waits for all the facts then decides. An empty one makes a decision before the investigation is over.
ferguson*500307001629745152*@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 the investigation (e.g., that officer had a facial injury).
ferguson*500307001629745152*@rui_xu @flavius217 They can't release shooting info cause they are still interviewing witnesses. Media wanted this info.
ferguson*500307001629745152*@rui_xu @flavius217 They can't tie the two together cause they are separate issues. Releasing at different times puts distance between them.
ferguson*500307001629745152*@dissuade p sure you know the answer to that question.
ferguson*500307001629745152*@dissuade it's also pretty upsetting that a kid was summarily executed for maybe stealing a pack of cigars.
ferguson*500307001629745152*@flavius217 Also per last press conf, local PD depts seem super disconnected and out of touch with African American community.
ferguson*500307001629745152*@dissuade I believe I read something like Ferguson is 29% white but the PD is 94% white.
ferguson*500307001629745152*@flavius217 White or Black the biggest prob people have with police is the attitude from cops. We are a guilty till proven innocent society.
ferguson*500307001629745152*@dissuade strongly agree. I know policing is a terribly high-stress job, but most people are not criminals.

sydneysiege*544462330105712640*@chookelini @suthernx @RunawayBudgie @onewaymule87 @smh @ZJGarred Understood.:-)
sydneysiege*544462330105712640*@suthernx @RunawayBudgie @onewaymule87 @smh @ZJGarred Yep, but there's nothing mainstream about him.
sydneysiege*544462330105712640*@leftocentre @RunawayBudgie @onewaymule87 @smh @ZJGarred Ray Hadley has rated number one in Sydney since 2004. Truly hope RWNJ's wakeup
sydneysiege*544462330105712640*@suthernx @RunawayBudgie @onewaymule87 @smh @ZJGarred They won't.Hadley feeds the rednecks paranoia with his own ego.
sydneysiege*544462330105712640*@leftocentre @riffraff0001 @onewaymule87 @smh @ZJGarred Doing what Hadley does best

sydneysiege*544462330105712640*@onewaymule87 @smh @ZJGarred he doesn't need the ratings he's number 1 by a mile

sydneysiege*544319832486064128*@asstnews @ap Sorry.I have been watching the coverage for a while now. Just thought AP was quicker than that.  Tweet was posted 5 min ago.

ferguson*500280838710247424*@bonedog84 @DIANAZOGA @AntonioFrench We will not rest until there is Justice here.  Even if true, Mike Brown did not deserve execution.
ferguson*500280838710247424*@IamLaurenGill @DIANAZOGA old saying "there's always two sides to a story"
ferguson*500280838710247424*@Sbragg420 @DIANAZOGA how many times do innocent "Black men" fit the description tho ?

ferguson*500280838710247424*@Sbragg420 @DIANAZOGA that's problematic.
ferguson*500280838710247424*@Sbragg420 @DIANAZOGA and unfortunately we'll never hear the other side of the story because he's dead
ferguson*500280838710247424*@Shirking_Violet @DIANAZOGA @AntonioFrench that is MY ERROR. There is no report confirming Darren Wilson is black. I retract my tweet.
ferguson*500280838710247424*@HaX_FR0ST @DIANAZOGA @AntonioFrench I haven't seen anyone say he was black. It is a somewhat common name.
ferguson*500280838710247424*@stljv @AntonioFrench I retract my previous tweet. Darren Wilson's race is NOT CONFIRMED. I apologize.
ferguson*500280838710247424*@JLa_NYC @DIANAZOGA "Strong armed" is being used to obfuscate; sounds like the perp was armed, which he wasn't, &amp; the crime was SHOPLIFTING.

ferguson*500286058664579072*@zadiaz @mashable no I'm sure the violent felon put his hands right up and the evil policeman after 6 yrs of service decided to kill 4 fun!
ferguson*500286058664579072*@Copscantweet2 are you afraid of admitting you're a racist ? Are you afraid of being called a racist ?
ferguson*500286058664579072*@zadiaz race doesn't matter to me nor should it matter to this case. You are the racist. Facts don't matter 2u Just blindly follow the herd.
ferguson*500286058664579072*@Copscantweet2 you do a lot of bitching and whining, but never make any points.

ferguson*500286058664579072*@accordingtoame @mashable @PDPJ Take a look at college football players, roughly same size and maturity (in terms of looking older).
ferguson*500286058664579072*@species8472xgn @mashable @PDPJ my brother played, I'm familiar with their size
ferguson*500286058664579072*@CheriPhi @mashable That maybe he did try &amp; take cops gun though window (something witnesses could not see). This goes toward CHARACTER. 😐
ferguson*500286058664579072*@zadiaz @mashable He wasn't a kid, an Adult who was robbing a business.
ferguson*500286058664579072*@TracyMo53321503 @mashable are you justifying the murder of an unarmed ADULT ?
ferguson*500286058664579072*@TracyMo53321503 @mashable you're one sick racist bitch

ferguson*500286058664579072*@at_the_foxhole @TracyMo53321503 @zadiaz @mashable then what's the relevance ?

ferguson*500286058664579072*@TracyMo53321503 @at_the_foxhole @zadiaz @mashable I said teen not child but again, how is the pic relevant ?
ferguson*500286058664579072*@drpolson @TracyMo53321503 @zadiaz @mashable A black cop shot Mr. Brown if he is charged (it will be racist) there will be more riots.

ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@TwitchieRich @kellyoxford I try…. Unfortunately I don’t think it’d protect me against bullets
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@HDMcC maybe people shouldn't look to the tweets of comedy writers for their news facts ?
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@HDMcC @kellyoxford @obiterdictayo CBC news is reporting the gunman has been shot. Are you bitching at them also ?
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@kellyoxford @daxshepard1 yes from her newly decorated LA living room. Just like Egypt.
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@daxshepard1 @HDMcC @kellyoxford No, you're right. We should follow comedic writers and trust their sources. That's my first instinct.
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@jeremysale @daxshepard1 @HDMcC hey kid, go enjoy this weird sense of power I've afforded you this morning. Spend it wisely!!
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@subloke @HDMcC I had confirmed the first gunman was dead when I tweeted.
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@kellyoxford @subloke you managed to confirm before any other news outlet in Canada. Bravo.
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@HDMcC @kellyoxford where's the "(sigh) I give up" emoticon ? Do you not understand twitter ?
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@HDMcC @subloke I can get confirmation and video from witnesses and pass info along without a news producer. Simple stuff.
ottawashooting*524947674164760577*@Donnajcherold @doctorfullerton @DaveBeninger hi Donna I think we are talking 2 different incidents now the quebec one is what I referred 2
ottawashooting*524947674164760577*@Donnajcherold @doctorfullerton @DaveBeninger Donna - the rcmp incident in Quebec versus today in ottawa
ottawashooting*524947674164760577*@NatriceR @Donnajcherold @DaveBeninger But both would indicate there is need to increase surveillance &amp; ability to detain
