ferguson*500280838710247424*@enjen99 @DIANAZOGA oh yes. Clear that something occurred, death still not necessarily the right result.
ferguson*500281131057811456*@TheAnonMessage2 omg stfu already. Did you see the clothes the kid was wearing, looked similar. Agree with you but quit fucking fishing.
ferguson*500286058664579072*@Copscantweet2 yep this picture proves he wasn't on his knees with his hands up. And the Mr Wilson didn't empty his gun on him. Nice work.
ferguson*500286058664579072*@zadiaz @mashable YES, it was JUSTIFIED
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@obiterdictayo I know what I'm doing here, thanks.
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@HDMcC @kellyoxford @obiterdictayo why shouldn't a private citizen make a comment on a news event ?
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@HDMcC @kellyoxford @obiterdictayo the news report I'm watching currently reported the same thing before Kelly tweeted it.
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@HDMcC @kellyoxford exactly, because they are "journalists" and "dems the rules" Kelly is a "comedic writer" no rules. Go police journalists
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@daxshepard1 @HDMcC THANK YOU.
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@jeremysale @daxshepard1 @HDMcC seeing as though I was 100% correct, yes.
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@kellyoxford @daxshepard1 @HDMcC Thanks, that was considerate of you! All the best.
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@kellyoxford @HDMcC I had heard the same before I saw you &amp; many others tweet.
ottawashooting*524932935137628160*@HDMcC @kellyoxford @subloke Perhaps all of Twitter should follow HDM so we can learn the proper ways of Tweeting responsibly.
